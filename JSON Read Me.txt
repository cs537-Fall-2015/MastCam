In order to run the file you must understand a few things.

1. MyClassHere class is an example class with basic variables with getters and setters.

	- Notice most data types are included

2. Change the filepath in WriteToJSON to a filepath for your personal computer, that's where the JSON file will be created.

	- Notice the json file is called Example.json
	- This can easily be changed on line 20
	- Run this program to create your json file

3. Change the filepath in ReadFromJSON to the same filepath you set for WriteToJSON, that's where you created the JSON file.

	- Again the filename must be the same as the one you defined in WriteToJSON
